# login_form_CodeIgniter4
I worked on creating a register and login page at CodeIgniter 4. To turn this project into a mini website, I added a home page for “Ahmed’s Radiant Path Yoga Studio”. I also added a picture to show the environment.

In this mini website, I used PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with Bootstrap.

Users could get information about the studio from the home page and could register via the register page. If registration is successful, the user will receive a congratulation message otherwise will be notified about the error. 
 
Next time, the user can login directly, no need to register again. If the user fills in the right email and password, user will get a welcome back message, otherwise the user will get a message for “invalid email or password”. User’s all information would be saved in the database but since I used a secure password method, so the user doesn’t need to worry about that. 

Home page has an address, contact and copyright info at the bottom of the page.
